# The Month That Was (TMTW)

![](tmtw.png)

A monthly short talk and/or rant for Melbourne Cocoaheads that covers the news since last meetup.

Topics can include 

- Apple news
- Mobile / IOT news
- Local Melbourne News
- Occurances or speculation based on events in the past month

The idea is to present a fast paced, relaxed and interactive presentation to break the ice at Cocoaheads meetups. 

# Contributing

The presentations so far have been done in markdown and presented wiht deckset. If you'd like to present a tmtw talk at a meetup get in touch with Jesse at jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au.

# Open Source

Ideally tmtw talks should be added to this repository each month as markdown files and pdf files for history sake.
